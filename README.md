# Delivery Fee Calculator

## To get started

* Unzip the file
* Open with your preferred text editor/IDE

* Run yarn start to start the local server
* Get calculating some delivery prices!

With this app you can calculate delivery fee's based on several factors:

* Small order surcharge when the cart value is below 10€ (the surcharge is the difference between the cart value and 10€)
* Delivery distance (Min fee is 1€, even if the delivery distance is under 500 meters. The delivery fee for the first 1000 meters is 2€ and an additional 1€ is added for every 500 meters)
* Large order surcharge, 5+ items ordered
* Delivery Fee can never be more than 15€
* Free delivery when the order is +=100€
* Friday Rush surcharge (total fee, including any possible surcharges multiplied by 1.1x, the fee still cannot be over 15€)
